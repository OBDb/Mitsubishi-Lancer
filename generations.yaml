The Evolution X continued the high-performance tradition with a new aluminum block, variable valve timing, and a sophisticated S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) system, though it would be the final Evolution model, discontinued in 2016. The mainstream Lancer received a series of minor updates throughout its extended production run but became increasingly dated compared to competitors, with production gradually phased out across different markets by 2017. Despite its age, it maintained popularity in certain regions due to its reputation for reliability, value, and distinctive styling."
